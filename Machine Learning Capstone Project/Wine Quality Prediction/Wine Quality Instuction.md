# Wine Quality Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting the quality of wines using machine learning techniques with Python programming language. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict the quality of wines based on various features.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

- **Fixed Acidity**: The fixed acidity of the wine.
- **Volatile Acidity**: The volatile acidity of the wine.
- **Citric Acid**: The citric acid content in the wine.
- **Residual Sugar**: The residual sugar content in the wine.
- **Chlorides**: The chloride content in the wine.
- **Free Sulfur Dioxide**: The free sulfur dioxide content in the wine.
- **Total Sulfur Dioxide**: The total sulfur dioxide content in the wine.
- **Density**: The density of the wine.
- **pH**: The pH level of the wine.
- **Sulphates**: The sulphates content in the wine.
- **Alcohol**: The alcohol content in the wine.
- **Target**: Wine quality rating (from 3 to 8).

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **pandas**
- **scikit-learn**
- **numpy**

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage

## Data Preprocessing

- **Handle missing values:** Missing values in the dataset are managed using techniques such as imputation or removal of rows/columns.
- **Feature scaling:** Standardize or normalize the features to bring them to a similar scale.
- **Feature encoding:** Convert categorical variables into numerical representations using techniques like label encoding.

## Machine Learning Model

Various classification algorithms can be used for this task, such as Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines (SVM). The choice of the model depends on the dataset and the problem's complexity.

## Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model's predictions align with the actual wine quality ratings.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict wine quality based on different features. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can create your own wine quality prediction model. Feel free to customize and experiment with different algorithms to improve the accuracy of your predictions.
