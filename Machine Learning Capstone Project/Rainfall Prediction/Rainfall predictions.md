### Rainfall Prediction Project

#### Overview

This project aims to predict rainfall using machine learning in Python. We'll be working with a dataset containing various weather features and their corresponding rainfall status (rain or no rain).

#### Requirements

Make sure you have Python installed on your system. Additionally, you'll need the following libraries:

- **pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **numpy**: For numerical operations.

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

#### Steps

1. **Load the Data**

   ```python
   import pandas as pd

   # Load the dataset (replace 'weather_data.csv' with your actual dataset filename)
   data = pd.read_csv('weather_data.csv')
   ```

2. **Prepare the Data**

   ```python
   from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split

   # Split features (X) and target variable (y)
   X = data.drop('Rainfall', axis=1)  # Features
   y = data['Rainfall']  # Target

   # Split the data into training and testing sets
   X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)
   ```

3. **Build and Train the Model**

   ```python
   from sklearn.ensemble import RandomForestClassifier

   # Create a Random Forest Classifier
   model = RandomForestClassifier(random_state=42)

   # Train the model
   model.fit(X_train, y_train)
   ```

4. **Make Predictions**

   ```python
   # Make predictions on the test data
   predictions = model.predict(X_test)
   ```

5. **Evaluate the Model**

   ```python
   from sklearn.metrics import accuracy_score

   # Calculate accuracy to evaluate the model
   accuracy = accuracy_score(y_test, predictions)
   print(f'Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}')
   ```

#### Conclusion

This simplified project demonstrates the basic steps to predict rainfall using Python and a Random Forest Classifier. Make sure to replace `'weather_data.csv'` with your actual dataset filename and customize the code as needed.
