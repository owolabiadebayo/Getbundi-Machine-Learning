# Rainfall Prediction Project

## Overview

This project focuses on predicting rainfall using machine learning techniques with Python programming language. The goal is to develop a model that can accurately predict whether it will rain based on various features like temperature, humidity, wind speed, and so on.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project contains the following columns:

- **Temperature**: Temperature in Celsius.
- **Humidity**: Relative humidity in percentage.
- **Wind Speed**: Wind speed in km/h.
- **Pressure**: Atmospheric pressure in hPa.
- **Cloud Cover**: Cloud cover in percentage.
- **Target**: Rainfall status (1 for rain, 0 for no rain).

## Requirements

Make sure you have the following Python libraries installed:

- **pandas**
- **scikit-learn**
- **numpy**

You can install these libraries using `pip`:

```bash
pip install pandas scikit-learn numpy
```

## Usage

## Data Preprocessing

- **Handle missing values:** Missing values in the dataset are managed using techniques such as imputation or removal of rows/columns.
- **Feature scaling:** Standardize or normalize the features to bring them to a similar scale.
- **Feature selection:** Choose relevant features that influence rainfall prediction and remove unnecessary ones.

## Machine Learning Model

Classification algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, or Support Vector Machines (SVM) can be used for this task. The choice of the model depends on the dataset and the problem's complexity.

## Evaluation

The model's performance can be evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model's predictions align with the actual rainfall status.

## Conclusion

This project demonstrates the use of machine learning techniques to predict rainfall based on different weather features. By following the steps outlined in this README, you can create your own rainfall prediction model. Feel free to customize and experiment with different algorithms and techniques to improve the accuracy of your predictions. Stay curious and explore further enhancements to make your model even more robust.
